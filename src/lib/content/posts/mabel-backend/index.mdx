# Mabel - Backend Architecture

Building the backend for an AI companion presents unique challenges. How do you balance personalization with privacy? Scale with intimacy?

## Core Requirements

- **Privacy First**: End-to-end encryption for personal data
- **Real-time Sync**: Seamless experience across devices
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining conversation state and history
- **Scalable AI Integration**: Efficient LLM API management

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Layer
Using Supabase for its real-time capabilities and row-level security. This gives us PostgreSQL's reliability with modern developer experience.

### AI Pipeline
- Message queuing for LLM requests
- Caching layer for common interactions
- Fallback strategies for API failures

### Security Model
Every piece of user data is encrypted at rest. We can't read your conversations, and that's by design.

## Lessons Learned

Building for privacy first actually simplifies many architectural decisions. When you can't access user data, you're forced to build better abstractions.
