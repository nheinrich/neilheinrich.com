# Mabel, an AI friend that wants the best for you

What if AI companions were designed not for engagement metrics, but for genuine human flourishing?

## The Vision

Mabel is an exploration into what happens when we build AI with different incentives. Not to maximize screen time or generate revenue, but to genuinely support human growth and wellbeing.

## Beyond Chatbots

This isn't about creating another chatbot. It's about crafting an experience that understands context, remembers what matters, and knows when to push and when to provide comfort.

## The Challenge

Building something that truly wants the best for you requires rethinking everything - from the architecture to the interaction patterns to the business model itself.

*This is the beginning of a series exploring the development of Mabel. Follow along as we build something different.*
