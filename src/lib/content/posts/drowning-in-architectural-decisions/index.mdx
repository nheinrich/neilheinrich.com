# Drowning in Architectural Decisions

We have more options than ever for building software. This is both a blessing and a curse.

## The Paralysis of Choice

- Next.js or Remix or SvelteKit?
- Postgres or Mongo or DynamoDB?
- Vercel or Railway or self-host?
- REST or GraphQL or tRPC?

Each decision spawns ten more. Each comparison article contradicts the last.

## The Cost of Perfection

While we're optimizing for a scale we don't have, solving problems we don't face, our competitors are shipping.

## The Way Forward

### Start with Constraints
- What do you already know?
- What does your team know?
- What can you afford?

### Optimize for Change
The only wrong decision is one you can't change. Build abstractions that let you swap parts later.

### Ship to Learn
Your users don't care about your tech stack. They care about their problems being solved.

## A Personal Example

I spent two weeks evaluating database options for a project that ended up needing just SQLite. The perfect architecture for the product we didn't build yet.

*The best architecture is the one that lets you ship and iterate.*
