# Perfection is Task-Dependent

The same level of quality that's excellent for one task is wasteful for another. Knowing the difference is wisdom.

## The Perfectionism Trap

We often apply our highest standards to everything. This is:
- Exhausting
- Inefficient  
- Often counterproductive

## A Framework for Quality

### Mission Critical: 99.9%
- Production code
- Customer communications
- Legal documents
- Financial decisions

### Important but Flexible: 80%
- Internal documentation
- MVP features
- Team presentations
- First drafts

### Good Enough: 60%
- Brainstorming sessions
- Internal tools
- Throwaway prototypes
- Meeting notes

### Just Ship It: 40%
- Slack messages
- Experimental ideas
- Personal notes
- Quick fixes

## The Cost of Misalignment

### Over-Engineering the Trivial
I once spent two days perfecting an internal script three people would use once.

### Under-Engineering the Critical
I also shipped a customer-facing feature with "temporary" code that caused six months of bugs.

## Finding Balance

Ask yourself:
1. Who is the audience?
2. What's the consequence of failure?
3. How long will this live?
4. What's the opportunity cost?

## The Meta Point

This blog post? 70% perfect. And that's exactly right.

*Perfection is not a standard. It's a strategy.*
