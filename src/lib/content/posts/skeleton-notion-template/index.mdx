# Skeleton - Is it worth shipping a Notion template?

Skeleton is my personal productivity system built in Notion. People keep asking for it. Should I ship it?

## The System

Skeleton is how I manage:
- Project planning and execution
- Knowledge management
- Daily workflows
- Team collaboration

It's been refined over years of iteration. It works incredibly well... for me.

## The Template Trap

### What Makes Templates Hard

1. **Context Loss**: My system works because of how I think
2. **Maintenance Burden**: Templates need updates, support, documentation
3. **Customization Paradox**: Too flexible = confusing. Too rigid = useless
4. **Support Expectations**: Selling creates obligations

## The Business Case

### Pros
- Existing demand (50+ requests)
- Low marginal cost
- Passive income potential
- Builds authority

### Cons
- Support time sink
- Reputation risk if it doesn't work for others
- Distraction from core work
- Template market is saturated

## The Verdict

I'm building it, but differently:
- Open-sourcing the core structure
- Paid version includes video walkthroughs
- Clear boundaries on support
- Positioning as "starting point" not solution

Sometimes the value isn't in the template itself, but in teaching people how to think about systems.
