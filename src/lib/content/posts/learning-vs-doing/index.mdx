# Learning vs Doing

There's a tension between the time we spend learning and the time we spend doing. Both are necessary, but the balance is everything.

## The Learning Trap

It's comfortable to stay in learning mode. There's always one more tutorial, one more course, one more article that promises to make everything click.

## The Doing Imperative

But knowledge without application is just entertainment. The real learning happens when we put ideas into practice.

## Finding Balance

The key is to learn just enough to start, then learn the rest by doing.
