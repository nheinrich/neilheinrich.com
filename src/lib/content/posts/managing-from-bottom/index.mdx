# Managing from the Bottom of the Totem Pole

You don't need a title to be a leader. Some of the most effective management happens from individual contributors.

## The Power of No Authority

When you can't mandate, you must:
- **Persuade**: Build compelling cases
- **Demonstrate**: Show, don't tell
- **Collaborate**: Make others successful
- **Persist**: Change takes time

## Tactics That Work

### 1. Become the Hub
Be the person who knows what everyone is working on. Information is power.

### 2. Ship Solutions, Not Problems
Don't just identify issues. Come with fixes ready to implement.

### 3. Document Everything
Be the team historian. Write the docs others reference.

### 4. Build Coalitions
Find allies. Change happens faster with support.

### 5. Make Your Manager Look Good
Support flows to those who provide it.

## Real Examples

### The Standup Revolution
Changed our daily standups from 30-minute time sinks to 5-minute async updates. Started by just doing it myself, others followed.

### The Documentation Drive
Created a team wiki nobody asked for. Six months later, it was essential infrastructure.

### The Tool Migration
Convinced the team to switch project management tools by building a proof of concept on my own time.

## The Long Game

Managing up and across takes patience. You're playing a different game than those with formal power. But the skills you build are transferable anywhere.

*Authority is given. Leadership is taken.*
