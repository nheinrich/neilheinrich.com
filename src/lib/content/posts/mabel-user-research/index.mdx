# Mabel - User Research

Before building an AI friend, we needed to understand what friendship means in a digital context.

## Research Methodology

We conducted:
- 30+ in-depth interviews with potential users
- Analysis of existing AI companion interactions
- Psychological research on digital relationships
- Ethnographic studies of how people use AI today

## Key Findings

### People Don't Want Perfect
Users consistently rejected AI that was too agreeable or perfect. They wanted something that could challenge them appropriately.

### Context is Everything
The same person wants different things at different times. Morning motivation vs. evening reflection vs. crisis support.

### Privacy Paradox
Users want deep personalization but are deeply concerned about data privacy. This tension shapes everything.

### Authenticity Over Intelligence
People preferred an AI that admitted limitations over one that tried to know everything.

## Design Implications

These findings led to core product decisions:
- Implemented "moods" that affect interaction style
- Built in productive friction and challenges
- Created transparent data practices
- Designed personality with intentional limitations
