# Mabel - Memory Architecture

How do you give an AI meaningful memory? Not just data storage, but the kind of contextual, emotional memory that makes relationships feel real.

## The Memory Challenge

Traditional chatbots either remember nothing or remember everything with equal weight. Neither approach creates natural interaction.

## Hierarchical Memory System

We're implementing a three-tier memory architecture:

### Working Memory
Short-term context for current conversation. High detail, quick access.

### Episodic Memory
Key moments and conversations. Compressed but retrievable. Like human memories of important events.

### Semantic Memory
Learned patterns and preferences. What you like, how you communicate, when you need support.

## Emotional Weighting

Not all memories are equal. We weight memories by:
- Emotional intensity of the conversation
- Frequency of recall
- Explicit user emphasis
- Temporal relevance

## Privacy Considerations

All memory processing happens on encrypted data. The system learns patterns without exposing raw information.
