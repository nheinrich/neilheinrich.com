# Test Post

This is a test post to verify that our **SvelteKit content system** is working properly.

## Features Being Tested

- MDX parsing and rendering
- Frontmatter extraction
- Dynamic imports
- Server-side filtering
- Custom styling

## Next Steps

If you can see this content properly styled, then our native SvelteKit content system is working! ðŸŽ‰

Time to move on to implementing the slide-in feature with shallow routing.
