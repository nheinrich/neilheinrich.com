# Smaller Teams are Better

The myth of scaling through headcount needs to die. Smaller teams consistently outperform larger ones.

## The Math Doesn't Lie

Communication paths increase exponentially:
- 3 people = 3 connections
- 5 people = 10 connections  
- 10 people = 45 connections
- 20 people = 190 connections

Each connection is a potential point of miscommunication.

## Why Small Teams Win

### Speed
Decisions happen in minutes, not meetings.

### Ownership
Everyone owns outcomes when there's nowhere to hide.

### Quality
Fewer cooks, less compromised soup.

### Innovation
Constraints breed creativity.

## The Amazon Rule

Jeff Bezos's "two pizza teams" - if you can't feed the team with two pizzas, it's too big.

## Real World Examples

### WhatsApp
55 engineers served 900 million users. Instagram had 13 at acquisition.

### Our Experience
Our 4-person team outshipped a 20-person team at a competitor. We had:
- Daily shipping
- Direct customer contact
- No meetings about meetings
- Complete context for everyone

## When You Must Scale

If you absolutely must grow:

1. **Split, Don't Grow**: Two teams of 4, not one team of 8
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Each team owns distinct areas
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce inter-team coordination
4. **Shared Infrastructure**: But independent execution

## The Hard Truth

Most teams are too big because:
- Managers want larger kingdoms
- Hiring is easier than firing
- We confuse motion with progress
- We think more resources = faster delivery

## The Courage to Stay Small

It takes courage to say "we're complete" when everyone expects growth. But the results speak for themselves.

*Small teams aren't a constraint. They're a competitive advantage.*
