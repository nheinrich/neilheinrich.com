# Temporal Fidelity

We obsess over what to work on and how to work. We ignore when to work. This is a mistake.

## Time is Not Fungible

An hour at 6 AM is not the same as an hour at 3 PM. Your brain, energy, and environment are different beings at different times.

## Mapping Your Temporal Landscape

### Peak Hours
When your brain fires on all cylinders. For me: 5-8 AM, 8-10 PM.
- Reserve for: Creative work, complex problems, writing

### Good Hours  
Solid productivity, sustainable focus. For me: 10 AM-12 PM, 2-4 PM.
- Reserve for: Execution, meetings, collaboration

### Dead Zones
When you're a zombie. For me: 1-2 PM, 4-6 PM.
- Reserve for: Admin, emails, mindless tasks

## The Mismatch Problem

Most workplaces optimize for temporal convenience, not temporal fidelity:
- Meetings during peak hours
- Deep work in dead zones
- Creative briefs at 4 PM
- Stand-ups at optimal focus time

## Designing for Temporal Fidelity

### 1. Audit Your Time
Track energy, not just hours. When do you feel alive?

### 2. Protect Peak Hours
These are sacred. No meetings, no Slack, no exceptions.

### 3. Batch by Energy
Group similar energy-level tasks.

### 4. Communicate Your Map
Share your temporal landscape with your team.

## The Compound Effect

Working with temporal fidelity for one year equals:
- 2x the output
- Half the exhaustion
- 10x the satisfaction

## A Personal Example

I wrote this post at 5:47 AM. I scheduled the meeting about it for 2 PM. Same topic, different temporal requirements.

*Time is the only real resource. Spend it with fidelity to your nature.*
