# Hello World

This is the first post on this mysterious blog. It's built with **Astro**, **Svelte 5**, and **MDX**.

## Why This Blog?

A space to share learnings, experiments, and ideas that have historically stayed private. This blog represents a step toward building confidence in sharing publicly.

## Interactive Demo

Here's a Svelte component embedded directly in this MDX post:

<Counter client:visible />

## Code Example

Here's how you might write a simple function:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```

## What's Next?

- More posts about AI, teams, and creative experiments
- Interactive visualizations and generative art
- Learnings from building products and leading teams

_This post uses MDX to combine Markdown with interactive Svelte components._
